# WeCycle

An application that turns trash into cash. The we is for individuals, the shop owner, the manufacturer, and the government. Everyone can participate and all may be rewarded. Just like how nature disposes and recycles, together we can live in a cleaner world because we provide an economy to dispose of the products that we produce.



## Vision

Products have a way to be identified by a machine and when they are disposed the application will keep a ledger of the quality of it's disposal. Recycling yield a higher disposal score than disposing the same item in the trash, which is still valued because we don't want that item on the streets where our children play, or in the ocean.

All this provides us the automated motivation to dispose and not litter, and the potential of walking the extra mile to recycle

1. dispose and not to litter
2. to reuse instead of single use
3. to walk a block in order to recycle instead of the more convenient and immediate throwing it in the nearest trash bin.



## The participants 

Like the natural world has decomposers which are rewarded for transforming unused energy into useful energy, with WeCycle we will be able to reward for any kind of participation that goes into the the transformation or proper disposal of used products. 



## Examples

- Food Waste: can earn points if you do your own composting. You may also be able to take it to a community garden and earn points because you went there to recycle that energy.
- Single Use plastics: Lets be real, they are convenient and are not going anywhere, however we can be better stewards of the planet by doing our best to keep these things out of natural ecosystems by disposing of them in the right containers. 



## Scoring

In order to provide an incentive to the disposal of Goods we have to agree on a scoring system. So in the way to make and move things that minimize environmental impact, or in a more optimistic fashion for this project promote a better environment.

### The Value of Good Manufacturing of Goods

From lowest to highest we can value the Goods, themselves. 

So:

1. The proper disposal of Goods = the better
2. The quality of the disposal of Goods = the better
3. The reuse or re-purpose of Goods = the better
   - Does that mean that its double better because its a 2 for one deal?
4. Good that can decompose naturally = the better

1. Lower the amount of Energy used to create the Goods = the better

### The Value of the Distribution of Goods

Similarly, we can value efficient distribution of Goods.

So:

1. Lower amount of miles traveled = the better
   - Mile translate to fuel burned, electricity consumed, tires and asphalt used up. 
2. A more efficient form of transport = the better
   -  You don't need your new Electric bike shipped by Air to arrive tomorrow. Wait till 3 weeks, save a forest.

### Other weights 

- Negative weights: will penalize a Good or form of transport. Negative weights should be as fair as positive weights. Fairness is of the utmost importance in wecycle.

> If we are to re-balance then we must be balanced.

- Risks: The measure of the occasion where a Good or Product will cause more damage to the environment than what is anticipated. For example, we are okay-ish with the transport of petrol-based products though we are definitely not okay with oil tanker or pipeline spills.
- Return: A signed measure, as in it could be positive or negative, of the occasion where a Good or Product will benefit or damage the environment in the future. For example, today's electric cars have the potential to have a greater return than the gasoline cars because in the future we may have more of our electricity come from renewable resources like wind and solar. However, the tables can turn if only we can figure out how to turn Carbon dioxide, the by-product produced from burning fossil fuels, back into the form you purchased it at the Gas station. (i.e. Gasoline) If that happened, and happened cleanly, that would mean our machine will resemble nature. Some will exhale, other will inhale it back it, the ultimate recycling center.
