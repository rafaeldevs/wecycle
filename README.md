# WeCycle

An application that turns trash into cash. The we is for individuals, the shop owner, the manufacturer, and the government. Everyone can participate and all may be rewarded. Just like how nature disposes and recycles, together we can live in a cleaner world because we provide an economy to dispose of the products that we produce.



## Vision

Products have a way to be identified by a machine and when they are disposed the application will keep a ledger of the quality of it's disposal. Recycling yield a higher disposal score than disposing the same item in the trash, which is still valued because we don't want that item on the streets where our children play, or in the ocean.

All this provides us the automated motivation to dispose and not litter, and the potential of walking the extra mile to recycle

1. dispose and not to litter
2. to reuse instead of single use
3. to walk a block in order to recycle instead of the more convenient and immediate throwing it in the nearest trash bin.



## The participants 

Like the natural world has decomposers which are rewarded for transforming unused energy into useful energy, with WeCycle we will be able to reward for any kind of participation that goes into the the transformation or proper disposal of used products. 



## Examples

- Food Waste: can earn points if you do your own composting. You may also be able to take it to a community garden and earn points because you went there to recycle that energy.
- Single Use plastics: Lets be real, they are convenient and are not going anywhere, however we can be better stewards of the planet by doing our best to keep these things out of natural ecosystems by disposing of them in the right containers.
